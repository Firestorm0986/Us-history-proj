## Full Story
Desmond T. Doss, serving as a company aidman during World War II, displayed extraordinary heroism and selflessness in the face of intense combat. In the assault on a 400-foot high escarpment, he remained in the fire-swept area, disregarding his own safety, and tirelessly carried wounded soldiers to safety using a rope-supported litter. On multiple occasions, Doss exposed himself to heavy enemy fire to rescue and treat injured soldiers, even venturing within close range of enemy forces to provide aid.

His acts of bravery included evacuating wounded men from a strongly defended cave, administering medical assistance while under shelling and small-arms fire, and carrying a severely injured soldier to safety amidst enemy attacks. In a night attack, Doss risked being mistaken for the enemy as he tended to injured soldiers, continuing to provide aid until he himself suffered serious leg injuries from a grenade explosion. Despite his own wounds, he cared for himself and waited hours for assistance while under constant threat.

Even when caught in an enemy tank attack, Doss prioritized the care of a more critically wounded soldier over his own injuries. He bound his fractured arm as a makeshift splint and crawled 300 yards to an aid station, displaying unwavering determination and fortitude. His remarkable bravery and dedication saved numerous lives and earned him widespread recognition as a symbol of outstanding gallantry.

Desmond T. Doss's courageous actions throughout the war, carrying wounded soldiers to safety amidst relentless enemy fire and risking his own life to provide medical aid, exemplify extraordinary heroism far beyond the call of duty. His name became synonymous with bravery and selflessness, inspiring those within the 77th Infantry Division and beyond. Desmond T. Doss's unwavering commitment to saving lives amidst perilous conditions serves as a testament to his exceptional character and the indomitable spirit of human courage.
