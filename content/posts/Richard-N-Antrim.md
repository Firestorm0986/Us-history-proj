## Full Story
Richard Nott Antrim, a war hero and Naval officer, exemplified the true meaning of brotherhood and sacrifice during World War II. Graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1931, Antrim quickly became a respected leader among his peers. As the executive officer of the U.S.S. Pope (DD-225) when the war broke out, he inspired confidence and served as a capable leader to the men under his command.

On March 1, 1942, the U.S.S. Pope encountered disaster, and for the next three years, the surviving crew members would face unimaginable horrors. In the midst of the crucible of war, Antrim became a pillar of strength and a "big brother" to his fellow sailors. Despite the challenges and tests of their brotherhood, Antrim's leadership and support proved invaluable.

Antrim's story of courage and heroism remained largely untold for many years. After retiring from the Navy in 1954, he settled in Mountain Home, Arkansas, where he led a quiet life running a small tour boat. Antrim was a modest man who shunned attention and recognition. When asked about his Medal of Honor action by a friend and local newspaper editor, Tom Dearmore, Antrim made it clear that he did not want his story published. It was only thirty years after Antrim's death that the story was finally told, with the approval and assistance of his family.

Antrim's actions as a prisoner of war were extraordinary. During his three and a half years of captivity, he displayed not only courage but also ingenuity. Forced to take charge of a labor party constructing slit trenches for bomb protection, Antrim risked his life by rearranging the construction work to create a huge sign that spelled "U.S." This act, done under the watchful eyes of Japanese guards, could have resulted in his immediate execution. However, Antrim's plan successfully alerted the Allied forces to the presence of prisoners in the trenches, saving countless lives.

But it was Antrim's selfless and noble act in a POW camp that truly set him apart. Witnessing the brutal beating of a fellow lieutenant by a Japanese guard, Antrim stepped forward and pleaded for mercy. When his plea fell on deaf ears, he made an unprecedented offer: to take the rest of the punishment himself. Antrim's offer stunned both the prisoners and the guards. In a display of true brotherhood, he willingly endured the remaining lashes intended for his comrade. This act of self-sacrifice and unconditional love demonstrated the depths of Antrim's character and his unwavering commitment to his fellow servicemen.

Antrim's actions did not go unnoticed. He was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman on January 30, 1947, who commended him for his valor and remarked, "You did a mighty fine thing!" Antrim's story serves as an inspiration, not to glorify his heroism, but to remind future generations of the sacrifices made by those who came before them to preserve freedom.

Richard Nott Antrim, a war hero and a true embodiment of brotherhood, showed that the bond among men in uniform extends beyond the biological. Through his leadership, courage, and selflessness, he exemplified the highest ideals of military service and inspired others to put the needs of others before themselves.
